// `setTimeout` is a JavaScript function that allows you to schedule the execution of a function or a piece of code after a specified delay, measured in milliseconds.
// It is commonly used for implementing time-based actions, animations, or delaying the execution of a function.

// Here's the basic syntax for using `setTimeout`:
setTimeout(function, delay);

// - `function`: This is the function or code that you want to execute after the specified delay.
// - `delay`: The time (in milliseconds) to wait before executing the function.

// Here's an example of how to use `setTimeout`:
function myFunction() {
  console.log("Delayed message after 2 seconds");
}

// Schedule myFunction to run after a 2000ms (2 seconds) delay
setTimeout(myFunction, 2000);

// In this example, the `myFunction` function is scheduled to run after a 2-second delay.
// You can also use an anonymous function to define the code you want to execute directly:

// Schedule an anonymous function to run after a 3-second delay
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This message appears after 3 seconds");
}, 3000);

// You can also cancel a scheduled timeout using the `clearTimeout` function, which takes the timeout identifier returned by `setTimeout`:

const timeoutId = setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This message will never appear");
}, 5000);

// Cancel the scheduled timeout
clearTimeout(timeoutId);

// This is useful if you want to prevent a scheduled function from running if certain conditions are met.

// Remember to provide the function or code you want to execute and the delay in milliseconds when using `setTimeout`.
// This is a crucial feature for handling asynchronous behavior and timing in JavaScript.
