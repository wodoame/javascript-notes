`npm` (Node Package Manager) and `npx` (Node Package Executable) are both part of the Node.js ecosystem, but they serve different purposes.

1. **npm (Node Package Manager):**

   - **Package Manager:** `npm` is primarily a package manager for Node.js. It is used for installing, managing, and sharing Node.js packages (libraries or tools) in your projects.
   
   - **Global Packages:** You can use `npm` to install packages globally on your system or locally within a specific project. Global packages are typically used for command-line tools that you want to be available system-wide.

   - **Scripts:** `npm` also allows you to define scripts in your `package.json` file, which can be executed using the `npm run` command. These scripts are often used for tasks like building, testing, or starting a development server.

   - **Dependencies:** `npm` manages dependencies in your projects, and it generates a `package-lock.json` file to ensure consistent dependency resolution across different installations.

   Example commands:
   ```bash
   # Install a package globally
   npm install -g some-package

   # Install project dependencies
   npm install

   # Run an npm script
   npm run build
   ```

2. **npx (Node Package Executable):**

   - **Execute Packages:** `npx` is a tool that comes with npm (version 5.2.0 and higher) and is used to execute Node.js packages. It allows you to run packages without the need to install them globally or locally.

   - **Latest Version:** `npx` will always use the latest version of a package when executing a command, ensuring that you're working with the most up-to-date version.

   - **Temporary Environment:** When you use `npx` to run a command, it temporarily installs the package in a temporary directory, executes the command, and then cleans up the temporary environment.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   # Run a package without installing it globally or locally
   npx some-package command
   ```

In summary, while `npm` is primarily focused on package management (installing, managing dependencies, and running scripts), `npx` is a tool for executing Node.js packages without the need to install them globally or locally. It is particularly useful for running commands from packages that you don't want to have permanently installed on your system.

# Extras
`npx` is designed to intelligently handle the execution of packages, including scenarios where the required package is not already installed. When you run a command with `npx` for the first time, it checks whether the required package is available locally. If not, `npx` will temporarily download and install the package in a local temporary directory. Once the command is executed, `npx` cleans up the temporary environment.

However, `npx` is also smart enough to cache packages locally. This means that if you've previously executed a command with a specific package using `npx`, and that package is still available in the local cache, `npx` can execute the command offline without the need to download and install the package again.

So, when you use `npx` offline, it's likely because the required package is already cached locally from a previous execution. This caching mechanism helps improve the efficiency of running commands, especially when you're repeatedly using the same package.

Keep in mind that the behavior might slightly vary based on the version of `npm` and `npx` you are using, as there can be updates and improvements over time. It's always a good idea to check the official documentation or release notes for the latest details on the behavior of `npx` with respect to offline usage.
