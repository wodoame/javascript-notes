`package.json` and `package-lock.json` are both files used in Node.js projects to manage dependencies, but they serve different purposes.

1. **`package.json`:**

   - **Purpose:** The `package.json` file is a manifest file for your Node.js project. It contains metadata about your project, such as its name, version, description, entry points, scripts, and most importantly, the list of dependencies.

   - **Dependency Listing:** The `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections in `package.json` list the packages (and their versions) that your project depends on. Developers typically add or remove packages by modifying this file directly or by using npm commands.

   - **Human-Readable:** `package.json` is designed to be human-readable and editable. It's meant for developers to understand and manage the project configuration.

   Example excerpt from `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-project",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "dependencies": {
       "express": "^4.17.1",
       "lodash": "^4.17.21"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "jest": "^27.0.6"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **`package-lock.json`:**

   - **Purpose:** The `package-lock.json` file is created and updated by npm automatically. It serves as a record of the exact versions of dependencies installed in your project, including their transitive dependencies. This ensures that subsequent installations are deterministic and consistent across different environments.

   - **Locking Dependencies:** `package-lock.json` is used to "lock" the versions of dependencies, preventing unintended updates when installing packages. It includes detailed information about the dependency tree, resolved versions, and checksums.

   - **Not Meant for Manual Editing:** While it is a JSON file, `package-lock.json` is not intended to be manually edited. It's managed by npm and should be committed to version control to maintain consistent installations across different machines.

   Example excerpt from `package-lock.json`:
   ```jsonc
   {
     "name": "my-project",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "lockfileVersion": 2,
     "dependencies": {
       "express": {
         "version": "4.17.1",
         "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.17.1.tgz",
         "integrity": "sha512-sQkI8eQhuvd7F8rt8NlqWj2oNlYqL1yZQn0j+FV/QATLJLQ2eN8LFsZtAeoFplIfDnjOfp8O2mvxh4/MR4DVNQ==",
         "dev": true,
         "dependencies": {
           "accepts": { /* ... */ },
           // More dependencies...
         }
       },
       // More dependencies...
     }
   }
   ```

In summary, `package.json` is a project configuration file where developers specify dependencies, while `package-lock.json` is a machine-generated file that captures the specific versions and dependency tree for reproducible installations. Both files are important for maintaining consistency and reliability in Node.js projects.
