// `setInterval` is a JavaScript function that is used to repeatedly execute a given function or a block of code at a specified time interval.
// It's often used for creating animations, implementing periodic tasks, or scheduling repetitive actions in web applications.
// Here's the basic syntax of `setInterval`:

setInterval(function, delay);

// - `function`: This is the function to be executed at each interval.
// - `delay`: This is the time in milliseconds between each execution of the function.

// Here's an example of how you can use `setInterval` to repeatedly execute a function every 1 second (1000 milliseconds):


function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// Execute the sayHello function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
const intervalId = setInterval(sayHello, 1000);


// In this example, the `sayHello` function will be called every 1000 milliseconds, and the `setInterval` function returns an interval ID, 
// which can be used to later stop the interval using the `clearInterval` function.

// If you want to stop the interval, you can use the `clearInterval` function and provide the interval ID that `setInterval` returned:

clearInterval(intervalId); // This stops the interval

// It's important to note that the interval is not guaranteed to be perfectly accurate.
// The actual time between executions may be slightly longer if the JavaScript engine is busy with other tasks. 
// To achieve more accurate timing for animations or other time-sensitive operations, it's recommended to use `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother, synchronized animations.
