The `node_modules` folder is a directory created by Node.js to store the dependencies (third-party packages or libraries) that your Node.js project relies on. When you use a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) to install dependencies for your project, the packages are downloaded and stored in the `node_modules` folder.

Here's what the `node_modules` folder typically contains:

1. **Packages and Modules:**
   - The actual code and resources of the third-party packages that your project depends on.
   - Each package has its own directory within `node_modules`, named after the package.

2. **Nested Dependencies:**
   - If a package depends on other packages (dependencies), these dependencies are also installed in the `node_modules` folder. This creates a nested structure reflecting the dependency tree of your project.

3. **Metadata:**
   - Metadata files, such as `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock` if you are using Yarn), provide information about the installed packages, their versions, and the structure of the dependency tree.

4. **Binaries (if applicable):**
   - For packages that include command-line tools or binaries, executable files may be placed in the `node_modules/.bin` directory. This allows you to run these tools from the command line without specifying their full paths.

5. **Development Dependencies (optional):**
   - If you have dependencies that are only needed during development (such as testing or build tools), they may be stored in a `node_modules` subdirectory called `node_modules/.dev`.

It's important to note that the `node_modules` folder can become quite large, especially in projects with many dependencies. However, it's generally not necessary to include the `node_modules` folder in version control (e.g., Git) because the dependency information is stored in the `package.json` file. Instead, developers can install dependencies by running `npm install` (or a similar command) after cloning the project, and npm will recreate the `node_modules` folder based on the information in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`).
